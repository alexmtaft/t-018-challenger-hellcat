## v1.00  
* model from thingiverse by 1000%
* 22h print; PLA
* 70g of material; 23.45m
* layer height = .06mm
* extruder temp = 200.0c
* bed temp = 60.0c
* infill = 10%
* support structure = tree
* support overhang angle = 85deg (needed to to create support all over where it wasn't needed)
* support zDistance = .1mm (distance between top of support and bottom of structure)

attempt1: print body and all 4 tires at once. about 4 hours in the extruder fell off the printing 
arm in the middle of the night. noticed warping on the bed as well as the layer that was being printed.
there also looked like some burned spots in the white PLA. 
i suspect a warped end caught the extruder as it was moving into place and knocked it off. 

attempt2: print only the 4 wheels in isolation; will print the body separately in case another print fails. 
leaving all the other print settings the same and will apply glue a bit better to prevent warping from the bed.
